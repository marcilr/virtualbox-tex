=============================
Set subversion property such that that svninfo keywords get expanded in
myfile.tex file:

$ svn propset svn:keywords "Id" examples.tex 
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'examples.tex'
$


Build Process
=============
Traditionally, you converted your LaTeX source file to a DVI file, which could
then be  converted to PostScript with dvips.  This, in turn, can be converted
to a PDF file by ps2pdf:

		  latex		    dvips	     ps2pdf
	text.tex -------> text.dvi -------> text.ps --------> text.pdf

This requires all the graphics to be EPS files. But that's not a major problem,
as raster graphics can be converted to EPS.  Furthermore, the scalability of
vector graphics means clean-looking figures at all resolutions.  And vector PS
is usually very compact.

But what about using photographs, which are usually saved as JPEGs?  This
really isn't a problem, because the jpeg2ps command (from Debian's jpeg2ps
package) wraps JPEG images in an EPS header.

Filelist
========
build.xml
  Ant build.xml to compile LaTeX file crafted by Jason Kattell at
  DNR LRIS BPU.  He used the ant apply task to make it a bit more
  abstract.  Cool stuff.

clean.bat
  Remove dynamically created files from build process.
  Analogous to 'make clean' target.

  Build notes for LaTeX using cygwin.
