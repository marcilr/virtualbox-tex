Cygwin Build
============
Have been working on getting LaTeX to build PDFs conveniently
under Cygwin for my ami-hq-rm WinXP workstation.  Working
on the AMI MOA Inspection Request project.

Build PDF document with Cygwin. Cygwin is a Linux-like environment 
for Windows. 

Cygwin installation on ami-hq-rm WinXP workstation:
  D:\SW\Cygwin

Cygwin uses the teTex package installed under Doc/tetex-doc: The TeX text 
formatting system (documentation).


Cygwin binaries
===============
A number of Cygwin binaries are used to build the 
bsdinspect.pdf LaTeX document.

/usr/bin/make
/usr/bin/rm
/usr/bin/latex
/usr/bin/bibtex
/usr/bin/dvips
/usr/bin/ps2pdf
/usr/bin/sed


xdvi
====
To view *.dvi files in Cygwin.

# Start X server
$ cd /usr/X11R6bin
$ ./startxwin.sh          # startxwin.bat wasn't working.

# Use xdvi to view file.
$ cd ~/inspection_request/docs/database/bsdinspect-database/
$ ipconfig /all ==> 192.168.164.159
$ export DISPLAY=192.168.164.159:0.0
$ xdvi bsdinspect-database.dvi
